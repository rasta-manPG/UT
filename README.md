This mutator starts from the idea of Decl that wanted ,as a player, to see with some progress bars the domination status of each point by a team without pressing F3 to see the stats
The mutator is for unreal 99 domination mode.
The mutator is showing with red/blue bars and procents the domination status of each team on every domination point
The bars are set in the right position of every point lead by text of procentage
!-----! !-! 40%
!     ! !_!
!_____! !_! 59%
  NOOK
The text of precentage "%" is dinamically going up and down in relation with the team colour possesion
The mutator works for HudScale=0.400000 and 1920x1080 resolution
If you have different scale Hud will not be displayed corectly
